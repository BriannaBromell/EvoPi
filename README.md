# EvoPi
##Evolution simulator<br> 
  An individual-creature focused evolutionary simulor with basic UI. <br> **This program does _not_ use the NEAT package**
    ###Track your creatures by name and generation<br>
        Name plates for high-level visual tracking.<br>
        Selectable creatures to view creature information(genetics and relative data).<br>
        Syllable based first and last name generation for recognition.<br>
        Hereditary genome with mutation rates.<br>
      ###Seasonal game time system<br>
        4 seasons(minutes) separated by 60 days(seconds) as a game clock<br>
        Food blooms seasonally and sprinkles daily<br>
    -Game and creatures persist between sessions unless save file is deleted, progress will not be lost if close window (x) is used.<br>

Roadmap:<br>
~~Strength, speed, etc., are currently directly modified during mating. To make it more DNA-like, these traits should be derived from a genetic code.~~ <br>
Gene values influences multiple traits (pleiotropy), and traits could be influenced by multiple genes (polygenic traits).<br>
Year indicator<br>
Persistent surname & family tree support <br>
Species<br>
Carnivores<br>
Expanded food mechanisms<br>
<br>
<br>Ideas:
<br>Gene expression<br>     Some genes only activate under certain conditions, like reaching a certain age or energy level
<br>Epigenetics<br> Where environmental factors influence gene expression without changing the DNA. For example, if an organism experiences starvation, maybe its offspring have genes that make them more efficient at food utilization, even if their DNA is the same
<br>
<br>During mutation, instead of adjusting the trait directly, mutate the gene and then recalculate the trait based on the new gene value. This way, mutations are at the genetic level, and traits are expressions of genes
<br>Genetic disorders    or beneficial mutations based on probability. Some mutations could be harmful, reducing fitness, while others could be beneficial.
<br>Gene regulation networks<br>    how genes turn each other on or off. This could lead to emergent traits based on combinations of genes
