# EvoPi
Evolution simulator<br> 
  A custom individual-creature focused evolutionary simulor with basic UI. <br>
    -4 seasons(minutes) separated by 60 days(seconds) as a game clock<br>
    -Food blooms seasonally and sprinkles daily<br>
    -Selectable creatures for view info purposes.<br>
    -Syllable based name generation.<br>
    -Stats are hereditary and include mutation rates.<br>
    -Game persists between sessions unless save file is deleted, progress will not be lost.<br>

Roadmap:<br>

Strength, speed, etc., are currently directly modified during mating.<br>
To make it more DNA-like, these traits should be derived from a genetic code. Each gene could be a value that influences multiple traits (pleiotropy), <br>
and traits could be influenced by multiple genes (polygenic traits).
<br>
Species<br>
Carnivores<br>
Expanded food mechanisms<br>
<br>
<br>Ideas:
<br>Gene expression<br>     Some genes only activate under certain conditions, like reaching a certain age or energy level
<br>Epigenetics<br> Where environmental factors influence gene expression without changing the DNA. For example, if an organism experiences starvation, maybe its offspring have genes that make them more efficient at food utilization, even if their DNA is the same
<br>
<br>During mutation, instead of adjusting the trait directly, mutate the gene and then recalculate the trait based on the new gene value. This way, mutations are at the genetic level, and traits are expressions of genes
<br>Genetic disorders    or beneficial mutations based on probability. Some mutations could be harmful, reducing fitness, while others could be beneficial.
<br>Gene regulation networks<br>    how genes turn each other on or off. This could lead to emergent traits based on combinations of genes
